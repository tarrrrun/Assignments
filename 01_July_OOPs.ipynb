In simple words, all objects belonging to a same class share same properties called attributes thus they become more easy to access because these attributes give the program a structured shape. For example - In a class of vehicle, all of its objects contain vehicles but their subclass define number of wheels in them such as 2-wheeler or 4-wheeler.\n"
